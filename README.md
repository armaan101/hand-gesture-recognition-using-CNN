Hand Gesture recognition using opencv and CNN(keras)

Gesture recognition is a topic in computer science and language technology with the goal of interpreting human gestures via mathematical algorithms. Gestures can originate from any bodily motion or state but commonly originate from the face or hand.

The focus of this project is to detect different hand gestures mainly fist,peace,one and hand. The project is implemented in python using Convolutional Neural network.

Major Libraries used are Keras and opencv.

The project classifies each frame of live video feed into the above specified classes and displays it on the window screen.
